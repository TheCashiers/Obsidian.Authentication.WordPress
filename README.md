# Guide to enable localization
Localization files are contained in "lang" folder, .po files should be compiled to .mo files so that WordPress can load them.
See [https://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers#PO_files](https://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers#PO_files)

All compiled .mo files and their .po files should be put under ***WordPress Folder/wp-content/languages/plugins*** with names like ***obsidian-auth-zh_CN.mo*** and ***obsidian-auth-zh_CN.po***
