# Guide to enable localization
Localization files are contained in "lang" folder, .mo files should be compiled to .po files so that WordPress can load them.
See [https://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers#PO_files](https://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers#PO_files)

All compiled .po files and their .mo files should be put under *WordPress Folder/wp-content/languages/plugins* with names like *obsidian-auth-zh_CN.po* and *obsidian-auth-zh_CN.mo*
